## How Billing Works

Shoptimizer billing is handled entirely through Shopify. Here's what that means for you:

- **Charges appear on your Shopify bill** — You won't receive a separate invoice. Your Shoptimizer subscription is added to your regular Shopify billing statement.
- **Shopify handles payment processing** — You don't need to enter payment details into Shoptimizer. Your existing Shopify payment method is used.
- **Billing is monthly** — Your subscription renews each month on the same date you started.
