# Managing Optimizations

## What Are Optimizations?

An optimization is an A/B test that compares two versions of a product element — the original (called the **control**) and an improved version (called the **variant**). Shoptimizer shows each version to different shoppers and tracks which one leads to more sales.

For example, if the AI recommends a better product title, the optimization will show some visitors your current title and others the new title, then measure which one converts better.

## The Optimization Lifecycle

Every optimization moves through a series of stages:

### Draft
The optimization has been created but is not yet running. No shoppers are affected.

### Live (Active)
The optimization is running. Shoppers are being shown either the control or the variant, and data is being collected.

### Paused
The optimization is temporarily stopped. No new shoppers will see the variant, but your data is preserved. You can resume at any time.

### Completed
The optimization has gathered enough data and reached a conclusion. You can review the final results.

### Cancelled
The optimization was stopped and the product has been rolled back to its original state.

## How to Control an Optimization

On the **Optimizations** page, each optimization card has action buttons depending on its current status:

### Starting an Optimization
- Click **Activate** on a draft optimization to make it live. Shoppers will immediately begin seeing the A/B test.

### Pausing an Optimization
- Click **Pause** on an active optimization to temporarily stop it. Your collected data is safe — nothing is lost.

### Resuming an Optimization
- Click **Resume** on a paused optimization to start it running again.

### Cancelling an Optimization
- Click **Cancel** to permanently stop an optimization. When you cancel:
  - The A/B test stops immediately.
  - Your product data is **rolled back to the original** — whatever was there before the optimization started.
  - Your collected data is kept for reference, but the test is over.

## Understanding the Optimization Card

Each optimization is displayed as a card with the following information:

### Status Badge
A colored badge showing the current status: Draft, Active, Paused, Completed, or Cancelled.

### Product Name
The product being optimized.

### Optimization Type
What's being tested — title, price, or description.

### Change Preview
A side-by-side comparison showing:
- **Control** — The original value (what your product currently has)
- **Variant** — The proposed change (the AI's suggestion)

An arrow between them makes it easy to see exactly what's different.

### Performance Metrics
For active and completed optimizations, you'll see key numbers like:
- **Impressions** — How many shoppers have seen each version
- **Conversions** — How many shoppers purchased after seeing each version
- **Revenue** — Total revenue generated by each version
- **Revenue Per Visitor (RPV)** — Average revenue per shopper for each version

### Performance Charts
Active optimizations also show evolution charts that track how the control and variant are performing over time, so you can see trends develop as more data comes in.

## Filtering and Searching Optimizations

If you have many optimizations, you can narrow the list:

- **Filter by status** — Show only active, paused, completed, or cancelled optimizations.
- **Filter by type** — Show only title, price, or description optimizations.
- **Search by product name** — Type a product name to find its optimizations quickly.

## What Happens When You Cancel

Cancelling an optimization is safe. When you cancel:

1. The A/B test stops — all shoppers see the original version again.
2. Your product data is **automatically rolled back** to what it was before the optimization started.
3. No data is lost — you can still view the results the optimization collected before it was cancelled.

This means you can always cancel without worrying about leaving your product in a broken state.

## How Bayesian Allocation Works

Shoptimizer uses a smart system called **Bayesian allocation** to manage your A/B tests. Here's what that means in plain terms:

### The System Learns as It Goes
Instead of splitting traffic 50/50 for the entire test, Shoptimizer starts to shift more traffic toward whichever version is performing better. This happens automatically as data comes in.

### Why This Is Better for You
- **Fewer lost sales** — If the variant is clearly better, more shoppers see it sooner rather than waiting for a fixed test to end.
- **No sample sizes to set** — You don't need to decide how many visitors to include. The system handles it.
- **Continuous optimization** — The allocation updates automatically as more data is collected.

### What You'll See
On each optimization card, you may see the current traffic allocation (for example, "60% variant / 40% control"). This changes over time as the system becomes more confident about which version is winning.

### You Don't Need to Do Anything
The Bayesian system runs entirely in the background. There's nothing to configure — just activate your optimization and let Shoptimizer handle the rest.

## Tips for Managing Optimizations

- **Let optimizations run long enough** to gather meaningful data. At least a few hundred visitors per version is a good starting point.
- **Don't run multiple optimizations on the same product field** at the same time (for example, two title tests on the same product). Run them one at a time for clean results.
- **Check the evolution charts** to see if results are stabilizing before making decisions.
- **Use the Bayesian allocation** to your advantage — the system minimizes lost revenue while testing.
