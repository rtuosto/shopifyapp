# Getting Started with Shoptimizer

## What Is Shoptimizer?

Shoptimizer is an AI-powered app that helps your Shopify store sell more. It works in two main ways:

- **AI Recommendations** — The AI analyzes your product titles, descriptions, and prices, then suggests specific improvements that are likely to increase sales.
- **A/B Testing (Optimizations)** — When you accept a recommendation, Shoptimizer automatically runs an A/B test. It shows some shoppers the original version and others the improved version, then tracks which one performs better.

The goal is simple: help you make more money from the traffic you already have, without guessing what works.

## Installing Shoptimizer

1. Find Shoptimizer in the **Shopify App Store**.
2. Click **Add app** and follow the prompts to authorize it for your store.
3. Shopify will redirect you into the Shoptimizer dashboard inside your Shopify admin.

That's it — no code to install, no complicated setup.

## First-Time Setup

When you open Shoptimizer for the first time, there are a few quick steps to get everything running.

### Step 1: Sync Your Products

Shoptimizer needs a copy of your product catalog to analyze. On the **Dashboard**, you'll see a **Sync Products** button. Click it to pull in your products from Shopify. This usually takes just a few seconds.

Your products will sync automatically from time to time, but you can always manually sync whenever you add new products or make changes in Shopify.

### Step 2: Enable the Theme App Extension (Optional)

For the best experience, enable the Shoptimizer theme extension in your Shopify theme editor. This allows the app to track visitor behavior and run certain types of experiments.

Don't worry — this is optional for basic product optimizations (title, price, and description changes). Those work immediately without any theme setup. See [Settings & Setup](settings-and-setup.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 3: Explore the Setup Checklist

The Dashboard includes a setup checklist that walks you through each step. Items will be checked off automatically as you complete them.
