# AI Recommendations

## What Are AI Recommendations?

AI Recommendations are suggestions generated by Shoptimizer's artificial intelligence. The AI analyzes your products — their titles, descriptions, prices, and other details — and suggests specific changes that are likely to increase your sales.

Each recommendation explains exactly what it would change, why, and how much impact it could have.

## How to Generate Recommendations

There are two ways to get recommendations:

### For a Single Product

1. Go to the **AI Recommendations** page.
2. Use the product dropdown to select a specific product.
3. Click **Generate** to get AI-powered suggestions for that product.

### For Your Entire Store ("Generate Store Ideas")

1. Go to the **AI Recommendations** page.
2. Click the **Generate Store Ideas** button.
3. The AI will analyze your top products and create recommendations across your catalog.

This is a great way to get started — let the AI find the biggest opportunities across your store.

## Understanding Recommendation Cards

Each recommendation appears as a card with several key pieces of information:

### Impact Score (1–10)

A number from 1 to 10 indicating how much this change could improve your sales. Higher scores mean the AI believes this change will have a bigger positive effect.

- **8–10**: High impact — strongly recommended
- **5–7**: Moderate impact — worth trying
- **1–4**: Lower impact — may still be useful

### Optimization Type

The type of product data the recommendation wants to change:

- **Title** — Your product's name as shoppers see it
- **Price** — The listed price of your product
- **Description** — The product description text

### Proposed Changes

You'll see a clear before-and-after comparison showing exactly what the AI wants to change. For example, a title recommendation might show:

> **Current:** "Blue Snowboard"
> **Proposed:** "Premium Blue Snowboard — Lightweight All-Mountain Performance"

### AI Insights

A plain-language explanation of why the AI is making this suggestion. For example: "Adding descriptive keywords can improve search visibility and help shoppers understand the product's value at a glance."

## Accepting a Recommendation

When you see a recommendation you like, click the **Accept** button on the card. Here's what happens:

1. Shoptimizer automatically creates an **optimization** (A/B test) for that product.
2. The optimization is activated immediately.
3. Shoppers will start seeing either the original version or the improved version.
4. Shoptimizer tracks which version performs better over time.

You don't need to configure anything — it's all handled for you.

## Dismissing a Recommendation

If a recommendation doesn't seem right for your store, click the **Dismiss** button. The recommendation will be moved to the archive, and Shoptimizer will automatically generate a replacement suggestion so you always have fresh ideas to review.

Dismissing is not permanent — you can always restore dismissed recommendations later.

---

## Viewing Archived and Dismissed Recommendations

To see recommendations you've previously dismissed or that have been archived:

1. Go to the **AI Recommendations** page.
2. Click the **Archived** tab.
3. Browse your dismissed recommendations.

### Restoring a Recommendation

Changed your mind? Click the **Restore** button on any archived recommendation to move it back to your active list.

## Recommendation Quota

Each plan has a monthly limit on how many AI recommendations you can generate.

**During the beta period**, the quota is effectively unlimited — generate as many recommendations as you'd like.

After the beta ends, your quota will depend on your plan:

- **Free**: 5 recommendations per month
- **Growth**: 50 recommendations per month
- **Pro**: Unlimited recommendations

You can always check your remaining quota at the top of the AI Recommendations page. Quotas reset monthly.

## Tips for Getting the Most from AI Recommendations

- **Start with "Generate Store Ideas"** to let the AI find your biggest opportunities.
- **Accept high-impact recommendations first** (scores of 8–10) for the fastest results.
- **Don't be afraid to dismiss** suggestions that don't fit your brand. The AI will learn from what you accept over time.
- **Check back regularly** for new recommendations as your product catalog changes.
