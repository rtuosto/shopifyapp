# Dashboard

## Overview

The Dashboard is your home base in Shoptimizer. It gives you a quick snapshot of how your store's optimizations are performing and helps you stay on top of important tasks.

When you open Shoptimizer, the Dashboard is the first thing you see.

## Key Metrics

At the top of the Dashboard, you'll find summary cards showing your most important numbers:

### Conversion Rate
The percentage of shoppers who make a purchase. A higher conversion rate means more of your visitors are buying. Shoptimizer's optimizations are designed to push this number up.

### Average Order Value (AOV)
The average amount a customer spends per order. Some optimizations — especially price testing — can help you find the price point that maximizes revenue without hurting sales volume.

### Revenue
Your total revenue tracked by Shoptimizer. This includes both revenue from optimized products and overall store revenue when available.

### Revenue Lift
The additional revenue generated specifically by your optimizations. This tells you how much extra money Shoptimizer has helped you earn compared to what would have happened with your original product data.

### Incremental Metrics
You'll also see metrics broken down by:
- **All-time** — Cumulative results since you started using Shoptimizer
- **Active optimizations** — Results from currently running A/B tests only

---

## Performance Charts

Below the metric cards, you'll find charts that visualize your optimization performance over time. These charts help you spot trends and understand how your store is improving.

The charts may show:
- Revenue trends across your active optimizations
- Conversion rate changes over time
- Comparisons between control and variant performance

## Active Optimizations Summary

The Dashboard shows a summary of your currently running optimizations, including:
- Which products are being tested
- What type of optimization is running (title, price, or description)
- The current status and early results

Click on any optimization to go to the full **Optimizations** page for more details.

## Product Sync

Shoptimizer needs an up-to-date copy of your product catalog to generate accurate recommendations.

### How Syncing Works
When you click **Sync Products** on the Dashboard, Shoptimizer pulls the latest product data from your Shopify store — titles, descriptions, prices, images, and more.

### When to Manually Sync
- After you **add new products** to your Shopify store
- After you **update product details** (titles, prices, descriptions) directly in Shopify
- If you notice that a product in Shoptimizer looks outdated

The sync status is displayed on the Dashboard so you can see when the last sync happened and whether it was successful.

## Setup Checklist

If you're new to Shoptimizer, the Dashboard includes a **setup checklist** that guides you through the initial configuration:

1. **Sync your products** — Pull your product catalog into Shoptimizer
2. **Enable the theme extension** — Set up the CRO Runtime for visitor tracking (optional for basic optimizations)
3. **Generate AI recommendations** — Get your first batch of AI-powered suggestions
4. **Activate your first optimization** — Start your first A/B test

Each item is checked off automatically as you complete it. Once all items are done, the checklist disappears and you're all set.

## Tips for Using the Dashboard

- **Check the Dashboard daily** (or at least weekly) to monitor your active optimizations.
- **Sync products** whenever you make changes in Shopify to keep recommendations accurate.
- **Use the setup checklist** to make sure you haven't missed any important steps.
- **Watch the revenue lift** metric — it directly shows how much value Shoptimizer is adding to your store.
